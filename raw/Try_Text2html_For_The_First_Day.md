# Try Text2html For The First Day

  Today I start a new repo named text2html.
  Using C programing Language to edit text file is a challangable work, because I'm not used to progress string in the past. The string.h file is a cherish.
## strcpy
  strcpy function is the function that copy a string to another.
  e.g. strcpy(str1, str2) means copy str2 to str1 from the first letter, both of them.
  I got to know about that function very long ago, but what a shame that I forgot it. I almost start to use a loop and a if to write a function like this.
## strcat and strncat
  These functions are the functions which can add the string to another, automaticly deal with the '\0' problem.
  e.g. strcat(str1, str2) means add str2 to str1 on the tail, and change the '\0' tag.
## struct using
  Struct is a great invention. But I didn't use it until now.
  Struct helps me to divide the inner struct of the data, and focus on what the data means. I don't need to find out where is the start symbol, where is the end symbol, where to replace the text by using the struct.
  Just malloc a place for the struct, and let the annoying things get away.
## error: expected ':', ',', ';', '}' or '__attribute__' before '=' token
  Struct can't be assignment when initing. 
## New conception
  Make all data on one structure. Use less pointer.
