# 博客的第一天

使用Jekyll搭建的博客开始运作了（虽然不久之后就放弃了Jekyll

新建的博客看起来非常的粗糙（先这样吧

## 在Ubuntu中使用Windows

Ubuntu默认apt源下载的Virtual Box有无法阅读磁盘文件的问题

但是通过从Oracle网站下载并运行deb文件的方式安装的Virtual Box可以正常工作

目前尚不知道原因（目前仍不知道原因


## 写程序处理物理实验数据（最终咕了

刚刚开始用Qtiplot，用起这个画图软件来感觉很好

但是画的图有问题，是坏值的原因

我需要写一个程序来去掉坏值

凌晨了，就这样吧（原来开始通宵的历史有这么早了

First Day! My Blog
===================

  With the help of the Jekyll team and lizer's easy-using website, I finally built up my own blog. However, apparently, it's crude,  very crude.
  I can't wait to set down something I met these days.
  
  Windows in Ubuntu
  -----------------
  
  There is an uncertain reason that the Virtual-Box downloaded by apt can't work well on that HP-Elite laptop with Ubuntu. Each time I open the VirtualBox, there'll be an warning that it can't read the virtual disk. I tried to switch the virtual disk mode to static, failed again. At first I thought it was because of the Inter Rapid Storage Technology. But before I reboot the equipment, an idea came up. I went to the Oracle official website and downloaded an deb package. apt remove, dpkg -i ... Finally, a Windows7 was installed.
  Hard to think about the strange questions.
  
  Coding for physic experiment
  ----------------------------
  
  After drawing the charts with QtiPlot for my physic experiment, Looking at the charts, I know there is something wrong.
  What's wrong?
  There're bad values should have been expeled. Drawing is just to be acquaintant with the new toy QtiPlot. I, still, need to code. I wish I know how to do it on Python, but I am not acquatant with Python. Using C may be a good idea.
  While I was coding, the twenty-forth day of March has gone.
  Pen should be put down. I need to continue my coding.Though it's very early a morning.
